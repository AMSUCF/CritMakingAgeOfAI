# DIG 3171: Digital Tools for the Humanities

## I. Course Description

Examination of digital tools and techniques, including web and games,
used for projects and research in digital humanities. This section of
DIG 3171 is a **Research-Intensive (RI) course**. This designation will
be noted on your transcripts. You will actively engage in research
processes and a significant portion of your grade will be derived from
course-related project(s) based on original research and/or creative
scholarship. 

## II. Course Purpose & Objectives

The course examines digital humanities tools through the lens of
critical making. This course provides an introduction to digital
humanities discourse, intentional design, multimodal development, and
digital tools.

Students will be able to:

-   Use emerging technologies to conduct and disseminate humanities research.
-   Understand the role of the Internet in the humanities.
-   Conduct humanities research with a variety of software.
-   Display their digital work on a professional digital portfolio.
-   Engage in scholarly discourse around the digital humanities.

## IV. Course Requirements

**Exercises & Conversations**

*Each week*, you will be asked to **complete an activity, reflect on
it, [and]{.underline} discuss your process.** I am always experimenting
with new platforms to enhance our conversations. This semester, we will
use **Yellowdig.** This multimodal platform rewards participation with a
weekly point maximum, so you will need to post weekly exercises that
consist of 3 parts: exercise, reflection, & replies. For full marks,
you'll need to post **several times each week**.

The **first exercise is the Academic Verification Activity**, which is
due by the end of the first week of classes. *Yellowdig awards each
student per activity, with a weekly maximum limit.* There are 12
Exercises and one optional exercise on the Fall schedule.

**Final Reflection Paper (8 points):** This paper **serves as your final
exam for this course:** a short reflection on your experience in the
course and outline your next steps for your research, career goals, etc.

**Labs**

Labs are hands-on critical making assignments to help you learn
about each digital humanities tool and how projects using the tool fit
in the overall discourse of the field. Resources and **optional, virtual
class times are available** for each of the four lab assignments.

In the first lab, you will create a digital portfolio, and you will post
the remaining assignments and labs there. **This course emphasizes
process over product**; the research and thought behind each digital
product is much more important than the appearance of digital product
itself.

**Research Assignments**

The major research component of this course is broken into 4 smaller
research assignments: A) Project Proposal, B) Annotated Bibliography, C)
Abstract, D) Digital Project.

## Week 1: Welcome! (Start here) {#week-1-welcome-start-here .unnumbered}

**This course is Research Intensive**

This course section carries the **HIP-Research Intensive
designation**. This designation will be noted on your transcripts.
Research-Intensive is one of the four High Impact Practice course
designations at UCF, along with Service Learning, Integrative Learning,
and Global Learning. High Impact Practice courses are some of the most
challenging and rewarding at UCF. You will actively engage in research
processes and a significant portion of your grade will be derived from
course-related project(s) based on original research and/or creative
scholarship. 

The research in this course will be conducted through a **critical
making** lens. This is a newer method of research, and I\'m excited to
share it with you. If you like this mode of thinking, be on the lookout
for a full digital humanities course on critical making\--coming soon!

As you can see on the syllabus, this course consists of 4 labs where you
will try out new digital humanities tools, and then you will use one (or
more) of those digital tools to create a final research project. All of
this digital work will be posted to your **digital portfolio**, so by
the end of the course, you will have a robust website full of impressive
work samples!

If you\'re considering graduate school, this is an excellent opportunity
to dip your toe into the research waters! If you aren\'t, this course
will provide you with experience with digital tools, critical thinking,
and public speaking: relevant no matter what you do after graduation! 

Specifically, the assignments in this course will provide you with
opportunities to practice: 

-   Using emerging technologies to conduct and disseminate humanities
    research.
-   Understanding the role of the Internet in the humanities.
-   Using a variety of software for humanities research.
-   Creating digital narratives to enable creative and scholarly
    pursuits.
-   Displaying digital work on a professional digital portfolio.
-   Engaging in scholarly discourse around the digital humanities.
-   Conducting and presenting original critical making research.

**This course uses a \"choose your own adventure\" (CYOA) design**

Again, since you all have so many different majors and prior
experiences, I have structured each lab to accommodate several different
digital tools. This course is meant to be a sort of \"sampler platter\"
of digital tools\--so feel free to take a look at all of the options in
each lab before deciding! You are also encouraged save these resources
so that you can experiment on your own time with your own topics. 

**Unlike** a true CYOA game or novel, however, you must still **progress
through the course in the order it is listed**. Each lab will have a
list of digital tools you may select to complete the lab, and you may
select **any research topic **for most of the assignments. I am open to
additional digital tools not listed, but you must **ask for
approval **before selecting a tool that is not on the list. 

**This course emphasizes process over product**

Critical making is much more focused on the **process** and
the **argument** or **critical statement **the work is trying to make.
Most critical making works\--even those presented at academic
conferences and even some museums\--are **prototypes** or
proofs-of-concept. The whole point in doing this work is to **make your
audience think about something in a new way**. The point is **not** to
have a polished, or \"shippable\" product. 

Therefore, I recommend working with **tools that are new to you **rather
than tools you already know. This approach will be the most rewarding
because it will challenge you: you\'ll have to think in a different way
about your topic and your intended audience, and you will acquire new
digital skills along the way!

Let\'s get started!

### The Digital Portfolio (Lab 1) {#the-digital-portfolio-lab-1 .unnumbered}

For this course, you need to post all of your assignments to your
own **digital portfolio**. This serves several purposes: to will help
you create or add to your professional work, increase your digital
presence, and provide me with one convenient location to review your
work.

While I encourage you to create completely new works for all of the
other labs, if you already have a website you like, you may use that for
this lab. 

Don\'t neglect your digital presence! 

Digital portfolios are rapidly becoming an expected portion of job
applications for many fields. Having work online ready to send with your
application will be a big help to you as you embark on your job search
journey. 

This article has some [helpful tips for digital
portfolios.](https://www.themuse.com/advice/4-secrets-to-building-a-portfolio-thatll-make-everyone-want-to-hire-you)

Do you learn better from **bad examples? **Check out the [**worst
portfolio ever**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220501192335/http:/theworstportfolioever.com/) for
some tips about what **not **to do - and read [its companion
page](https://www.alexcornell.com/the-worst-portfolio-ever/) to
understand why this portfolio is so bad.

Choose your own adventure

There are three website platforms I recommend for this assignment:

**1. Wix: **<https://www.wix.com/>

- I recommend using the free version of Wix. It is user-friendly, and
    though no coding is required, it allows you to customize things
    using code (and you can find lots of help from others using Google).
- I **do not recommend using Wix ADI. **
- Only the **Wix Editor **will allow you to create a site with any layout, font, etc.
- Templates in Wix are overly constraining.

**2. WordPress: **<https://wordpress.com/>

-   For whatever reason, WordPress is the most popular website creator
    on the Internet today. It is rather likely that your company will be
    using it. (UCF even uses it for department websites!)
-   However, as it has gained popularity, it has continually stripped
    away the available features\--to the point that on my
    own [professional website](https://ekjphd.com/), I can\'t customize
    very much or modify the CSS\--and I pay annually for the \"premium\"
    plan! (I resorted to the HTML-only editor, and I still have spacing
    issues.)

**3. Google Sites:** <https://sites.google.com/new> 

-   This platform is not used widely at UCF because we are a \"Microsoft
    Campus\" rather than a \"Google Campus,\" but Google still makes
    their websites available for anyone to use.
-   If you are familiar with Google docs, slides, etc. and their unique
    quirks, the transition to Google Sites should be an easy one for
    you. If you are used to a more robust/traditional web hosting
    platform, you may find Google to be frustrating.

Tips

-   You **do not need to purchase a domain name **for your site,
    regardless of the platform.
-   If you already have a portfolio online somewhere and would like to
    use it for this class, you **may** build on it for this course.
-   If you know of another free, user-friendly option that I should add
    to this list, please let me know!
-   Website **accessibility **is increasingly important- [glance through
    these guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#guidelines) to be
    sure your website can be enjoyed by a wide audience!

**Examples**

### Exercise 1: {#exercise-1 .unnumbered}

Each week, you will be asked to **complete an activity, reflect on it,
and have a meaningful discussion with your peers. **

Be aware that each week, this is a **three part assignment: **

-   **Part 1** will ask you to analyze, experiment, or explore a digital tool or product that used a digital tool.
-   **Part 2** will ask you to **reflect **on the exercise.
-   **Part 3 **will ask you to **discuss **your experience with the
    class.

**This is only graded in YellowDig: be sure to demonstrate that you also
actually did the exercise, post thoughtful reflections, and engage with
your classmates!**

**Please use the topic \"Exercises\" for this week\'s exercise posts.**

Think about the medium through which you feel most comfortable
expressing yourself. Do you prefer writing? Talking? Do you want to be a
YouTube star? Whichever approach you wish to take is up to you -
YellowDig supports videos, audio, and more. (It automatically awards
points for word count only - posting audio or video will require me to
award points manually unless you also post your transcript - but that\'s
fine; I will do that.) 

#### What is [Due in YellowDig](https://ucf.yellowdig.app/community/62fd10e5-474b-50de-43b2-811e39b2a598) {#what-is-due-in-yellowdig .unnumbered}

-   **Part 1 (Exercise) **

    -   **Analyze **an early website using the [Wayback
        Machine](https://archive.org/web/). Search for an old version of
        your favorite digital source of news, entertainment, shopping,
        etc. **Make note** of its layout and things that you find
        surprising, out of the ordinary, or just plain odd.  

    -   *Not sure what to search? Try [this
        one](https://www.angelfire.com/comics/gnlib/) or [this
        one](http://www.angelfire.com/yt3/fanfiction/) or really, [any
        of
        these](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/17-angelfire-pages-that-are-still-up-right-now) (images
        aren\'t available, but most links still work). *

-   **Part 2 (Reflection)**

    -   In writing or speech, reflect on your experience, especially the
        aspects of the old websites that are not commonly seen in modern
        websites.

    -   Why do you think this is?

    -   What norms do we expect websites to have? How jarring is it to
        see a site that does not follow these norms?

    -   What was the experience like for you, a modern Internet user,
        visiting this outdated site? 

-   **Part 3 (Discussion) **

    -   Please **engage** with your peers. I\'m not going to require a
        minimum number of posts/replies this semester - just please
        continue the conversation in a way that is beneficial for
        everyone.

    -   **Extend the conversation. **Don\'t just agree or disagree with
        their opinions and observations. Respectfully disagree and
        clearly state your reasons, provide insight or a perspective
        your classmates may not have thought about, and so forth.

    -   **Ask** each other questions to clarify their opinions and
        thoughts, share experiences and perspectives that might extend
        their thinking or provide them with ideas for their own work in
        the future, etc.

## Create {#create-1 .unnumbered}

### Post Exercise 2 (exercise, reflection, & replies)

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-1 .unnumbered}

Each week, you will be asked to **complete an activity and reflect on
it:** thinking deeply about the process of making and experimenting with
various digital tools. 

**This week, I\'d like you to share your digital portfolio with your
classmates** as well as **reflect on your process **and **read about the
process of others in the course. **It can be helpful to look at the
design and organization of other digital portfolios to get ideas to
improve your own.

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-1 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **THREE POST assignment. **

You will first **post a link/screenshot of your digital portfolio** and
write a **brief reflection** on your process of creating the digital
portfolio. Think about where you might appreciate having advice or the
opinion of someone else.

Then, you will **reply to two classmates **offering advice
or **specific **feedback.

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **THREE POST assignment: **

-   **[Post 1:]{.underline}**

    -   Post the **link **to your digital portfolio

        -   OR a **screenshot **of the **\"about me\" page and Exercise
            1 **(if you prefer not to share your password or allow your
            peers to explore your whole site)

    -   **Reflect **on the process of making your portfolio. Evaluate
        your strengths and weaknesses. What was easy? What was more
        difficult? **3-5 sentences minimum.**

-   **[Posts 2 and 3:]{.underline}** 

    -   **Reply **to at least two people with **specific feedback. At
        least 5 sentences minimum.**

        -   If they struggled with a specific tool and you have a
            suggestion or a link to a tutorial, share your advice!

        -   If they struggled with layout, color scheme, or other web
            design topics and you have a suggestion, offer it!

        -   If you think they did something **well, **tell them!

            -   This needs to be **specific **to get full credit.

            -   Do **NOT **reply with a vague, \"I like your site\" or
                \"cool color scheme.\"

            -   Your reply should demonstrate that you read their site
                and thought deeply about what digital portfolios should
                and should not do.

### Digital Portfolio Lab

#### Assignment Rationale {#assignment-rationale .unnumbered}

# Week 4: Place and Space (Part A)  {#week-4-place-and-space-part-a .unnumbered}

## Learn {#learn-2 .unnumbered}

### Module Overview (Place and Space Part A)

This module asks you to think differently about the places and spaces
you exist in each day. Think about where you are right now: virtually,
you are in a class reading an assigned Webcourses page. Physically, you
are in a building (or possibly outside or in a vehicle!). You are also,
simultaneously in a city, and if you are in the US, also a county, a
state, and country, and on Earth in a solar system and galaxy. You are
likely also in a place that holds specific memories for yourself and
others (your home, dorm, the library, etc.) as well as on indigenous
land. 

Each space where we exist invokes memories, emotions, and meaning in
many, many different ways.

## Explore {#explore-2 .unnumbered}

### **Google Earth**

Google Earth Web: <https://earth.google.com/web/>  (requires a Chrome
browser AND a Google account)

Google Earth Desktop: <https://www.google.com/earth/versions/> (requires
a download)

#### Overview {#overview-3 .unnumbered}

Google Earth allows you to create an annotated map. This could outline
and explain a factual, historical journey using modern map locations
(such as the path of the Olympic torch), it could explain where events
that predate modern countries took place (such as the journey of the
ancient Roman army), or it could follow the path of fictional characters
created by you or someone else. 

Google Earth Web is a download-free tool that requires a [Google
account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount) and the [Chrome
browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/). If you already have a
Google account and wish to create a  blank/dummy account, you will need
to either log out or open an [incognito
window](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3356840/how-to-go-incognito-in-chrome-firefox-safari-and-edge.html) in
your browser.  The Google Earth Desktop does not require the use of a
browser, but I think the download may be rather large.

**StoryMap.JS: <https://storymap.knightlab.com/> **

#### Overview {#overview-5 .unnumbered}

StoryMap.JS is a free tool created at the Northwestern University Knight
Lab intended to be user-friendly. The tool allows you to add information
(text and images) on top of images and maps. The projects are organized
in slides, much like Google Slides, but with StoryMap.JS, the author has
the freedom to select any image to traverse with their story.

### Post Exercise 3 (exercise, reflection, & replies):

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-2 .unnumbered}

Each week, you will be asked to **complete an activity, reflect on it,
and have a meaningful discussion with your peers. **

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-3 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **three part assignment: **

-   **Part 1** will ask you to analyze, experiment, or explore a digital
    tool or product that used a digital tool.

-   **Part 2** will ask you to **reflect **on the exercise. 

-   **Part 3 **will ask you to **discuss **your experience with the
    class.

**This is only graded in YellowDig: be sure to demonstrate that you also
actually did the exercise, post thoughtful reflections, and engage with
your classmates!**

Think about the medium through which you feel most comfortable
expressing yourself. Do you prefer writing? Talking? Do you want to be a
YouTube star? Whichever approach you wish to take is up to you -
YellowDig supports videos, audio, and more. (It automatically awards
points for word count only - posting audio or video will require me to
award points manually unless you also post your transcript - but that\'s
fine; I will do that.) 

#### What is Due in YellowDig {#what-is-due-in-yellowdig-1 .unnumbered}

Each week, this is a **THREE PART assignment: **

-   **Part 1 (Exercise)**

    -   **Experiment **with one of the \"place and space\" tools listed
        in this module.

    -   What are its **affordances **(features and capabilities)?

    -   What are its **constraints **(what won\'t the tool let you do)? 

-   **Part 2 (Reflection)**

    -   In writing or speech, reflect on your experience:

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   **What are the affordances (features and capabilities) of the
        tool you chose?**

    -   **What are its constraints (what won\'t the tool let you do)?**

    -   **How might these affordances and constraints impact your design
        process and resulting project?**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Part 3 (Discussion)**

    -   Please **engage** with your peers. I\'m not going to require a
        minimum number of posts/replies this semester - just please
        continue the conversation in a way that is beneficial for
        everyone.

    -   **Extend the conversation. **Don\'t just agree or disagree with
        their opinions and observations. Respectfully disagree and
        clearly state your reasons, provide insight or a perspective
        your classmates may not have thought about, and so forth.

    -   **Ask** each other questions to clarify their opinions and
        thoughts, share experiences and perspectives that might extend
        their thinking or provide them with ideas for their own work in
        the future, etc.

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-3 .unnumbered}

Each week, you will be asked to **complete an activity and reflect on
it:** thinking deeply about the process of making and experimenting with
various digital tools. 

**This week, I\'d like you to share your interactive map assignment with
your classmates** as well as **reflect on your process **and **read
about the process of others in the course. **It also can be helpful to
look at other digital narratives to get ideas to improve your own.

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-4 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **three part assignment: **

-   **Part 1** will ask you to analyze, experiment, or explore a digital

#### What is Due in YellowDig {#what-is-due-in-yellowdig-2 .unnumbered}

Each week, this is a **THREE PART assignment: **

-   **Part 1:**

    -   Post the **link **to your interactive map

        -   OR a **downloadable file **(if you prefer not to share your
            password or allow your peers to explore your whole site)

-   **Part 2:**

    -   **Reflect **on the process of creating your project.

    -   What was your **inspiration**?

    -   What did you **learn?**

    -   What do you wish was better?

    -   What was easy? What was more difficult? 

-   **Part 3:** 

    -   **Please engage with your peers. **I\'m not going to require a
        minimum number of posts/replies this semester - just please
        continue the conversation in a way that is beneficial for
        everyone.

    -   Provide helpful feedback in a supportive way, ask each other
        questions about your processes and experiences, share thoughts
        that might extend their work in the future, etc. **Ideas for
        replies:**

        -   If they struggled with a specific tool and you have a
            suggestion or a link to a tutorial, share your advice!

        -   If they struggled with layout, color scheme, or other web
            design topics and you have a suggestion, offer it!

        -   If you think they did something **well, **tell them!

            -   This needs to be **specific **to get full credit.

            -   Do **NOT **reply with a vague, \"I like your project\"
                or \"cool color scheme.\"

            -   Your reply should demonstrate that you have interacted
                with their full project and thought deeply about **your
                experience as a user **and what this type of tool can
                and cannot do.

### Interactive Map Lab

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-4 .unnumbered}

The ideas of \"place\" and \"community,\" along with what it means to be
a member of a community, being from a place, or occupying a
place\--physically or virtually\--is a very \"humanities\" question.

For this lab, you will create your own **Interactive Map.** I want you
to think deeply about place, space, community, **and the context of each
of these,** and then make a **statement** about it with your project. 

 

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-5 .unnumbered}

-   Look at the examples and resources in this module.

-   Consider the ideas and our understandings of place, space, and and
    how that influences our ideas of the world.

    -   Think about location in terms of: globe, continent, country,
        city, county, neighborhood.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   Think about context, change over time, movement over time
        (migrations, glaciers, etc.).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   THEN look at the feature options to best tell your story.

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-2 .unnumbered}

1.   A link to your Interactive Map **on your digital portfolio** that:

    -   has **meaningful** interactive elements (at least one layer or
        other data in addition to a map)

    -   makes a critical statement that calls attention to, questions,
        critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of humanity

    -   feels complete

2.  An abstract that **is posted on your digital portfolio or embedded
    within the project **(or both) that:

    -   clearly and thoroughly explains how your project calls attention
        to, questions, critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of
        humanity

    -   is between 100-200 words

    -   includes at least one citation in proper MLA or APA format.

        -   **Citation means a scholarly source. **[Search
            here](https://guides.ucf.edu/c.php?g=78763&p=508976) or

### Twine

**Twine: <https://twinery.org/> **

#### Overview {#overview-6 .unnumbered}

Twine is a text-based interactive narrative platform. It has gotten more
and more user-friendly over the years, to the point that the tutorials
for courses I taught a few years ago are not really useful! 

To create a Twine narrative, you just type your passage into a
word-processing box, then link that passage to the next passage. Each
passage can have one or many options\--and each option can go to a
different passage or the same, or a mix of these. 

Note: There are [several versions of
Twine](https://twinery.org/cookbook/introduction/story_formats.html), so
if you come across a tutorial that doesn\'t seem to match what you are
seeing on your computer, this is probably why. It\'s helpful to search
for the specific type of Twine you are using.

Want the most simple, in-browser option? That\'s [Twine
2](https://twinery.org/2/#!/stories).

### Bitsy

**Bitsy: <https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy> (click \"run tool\")**

#### Overview {#overview-7 .unnumbered}

Bitsy is a game creation platform that has unique constraints. The
graphics are \"retro\" style, and options are somewhat limited as far as
what games in this platform can and cannot do. If you are someone who
struggles with options, this may be a perfect fit for you! 

My daughter made her first Bitsy game when she was 7 years old, so
don\'t be intimidated!

### Module Overview Digital Narratives (Part B): 

We\'re rolling on through the Digital Narratives unit this week and
thinking through different methods and genres of the Digital Humanities.
As you prepare your Digital Narrative, please work to make your
narrative an intentional **critical** **making** work. I\'m really
looking for **compelling **narratives that ***call attention to,
question, critique, or celebrate*** some larger aspect of humanity. 

The **topic** is entirely your choice! Feel free to discuss it with your
classmates\--you can also contact me directly if you want my input or
are feeling lost. Often, the **topic **selection is the most difficult
aspect of these projects; it helps to find something you

Each week, this is a **THREE PART assignment: **

-   **Part 1 (Exercise)**

    -   **Plan out your digital narrative on a storyboard.**

        -   Consider free online tools like
            [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create/storyboards/) or
            [Miro](https://miro.com/aq/paid-search/storyboard-tool/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=S%7CGOO%7CNB%7CUS%7CALL-EN%7CBRAINSTORMING%7CCHANN&utm_adgroup=&adgroupid=158099913797&utm_custom=20969123723&utm_content=698355877864&utm_term=storyboard+tool&matchtype=e&device=c&location=9012393&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgJyyBhCGARIsAK8LVLOIseAO-T8qRPEGmUsJaF-n387e4mf559UFGz4L7vekEG6UjSKdqc8aArIJEALw_wcB)
            (free accounts required)

        -   Map it out on paper free-drawing boxes or using a [printable
            template](https://www.educationworld.com/tools_templates/template_strybrd_8panels.doc)

-   **Part 2 (Reflection)**

    -   In writing or speech, reflect on your experience.

    -   What are you excited about in your digital narrative? What
        aspects would you appreciate **peer feedback** on?

    -   What was the easiest part of the process for you? What was the
        most difficult? Why? What could make it go more smoothly next
        time?

-   **Part 3 (Discussion)**

    -   Please engage with your peers. I\'m not going to require a
        minimum number of posts/replies this semester - just please
        continue the conversation in a way that is beneficial for
        everyone.

    -   **Extend the conversation. **Don\'t just agree or disagree with
        their opinions about these narratives. Respectfully disagree and
        clearly state your reasons, provide insight or a perspective
        your classmates may not have thought about, and so forth.

    -   Ask each other questions to clarify their opinions and thoughts,
        share experiences and perspectives that might extend their
        thinking about the narrative or provide them with ideas for
        their own work in the future, etc.

### Exercise 5

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-6 .unnumbered}

Each week, you will be asked to **complete an activity, reflect on it,
and have a meaningful discussion with your peers. **

**This week, I\'d like you to share your digital narrative lab with your
classmates** as well as **reflect on your process **and **read about the
process of others in the course. **It also can be helpful to look at
other digital narratives to get ideas to improve your own.

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-7 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **three part assignment: **

-   **Part 1** will ask you to analyze, experiment, or explore a digital
    tool or product that used a digital tool.

-   **Part 2** will ask you to **reflect **on the exercise. 

-   **Part 3 **will ask you to **discuss **your experience with the
    class.

**This is only graded in YellowDig: be sure to demonstrate that you also
actually did the exercise, post thoughtful reflections, and engage with
your classmates!**

Think about the medium through which you feel most comfortable
expressing yourself. Do you prefer writing? Talking? Do you want to be a
YouTube star? Whichever approach you wish to take is up to you -
YellowDig supports videos, audio, and more. (It automatically awards
points for word count only - posting audio or video will require me to
award points manually unless you also post your transcript - but that\'s
fine; I will do that.)  

#### What is Due in YellowDig {#what-is-due-in-yellowdig-5 .unnumbered}

-   **Part 1:**

    -   Post the **link **to your digital narrative lab on your digital
        portfolio

        -   OR a **downloadable file **(if you prefer not to share your
            password or allow your peers to explore your whole site)

-   **Part 2:**

    -   **Reflect **on the process of completing this assignment.

    -   Why did you choose your **topic**?

    -   What did you **learn?**

    -   What was easy? What was more difficult?

    -   What limitations of the tool did you discover?

-   **Part 3:** 

    -   **Reply **to at least two people with **specific feedback. **

        -   If they struggled with a specific tool and you have a
            suggestion or a link to a tutorial, share your advice!

        -   If they struggled with other aspects of the analysis process
            and you have a suggestion, offer it!

        -   If you think they did something **well, **tell them!

            -   This needs to be **specific **to get full credit.

            -   Do **NOT **reply with a vague, \"I like your analysis\"
                or \"interesting topic.\"

            -   Your reply should demonstrate that you have read their
                full analysis and thought deeply about it as well as
                what this type of tool can and cannot do.

### Digital Narrative Lab

####  Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-7 .unnumbered}

You have several options for user-friendly platforms to create powerful
interactive narrative experiences. 

In Twine, Bitsy, and Omeka, you can create different possibilities for
your reader/player, you will be rather deeply considering different
perspectives, scenarios, etc. for a given topic and narrative.

All of these tools ask you to think deeply and differently about what a
narrative is, what it means to tell a story, and how the author and the
reader/player can share roles.

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-8 .unnumbered}

Decide what **topic** your narrative will target- this is the critical
making aspect. What \'ism\' or theory or literary perspective might your
story, game, timeline, or collection use to make an argument about the
world?

What types of genres and perspectives might be best suited for a
choose-your-own-adventure style interactive narrative? 

What choices will your reader or player need to make?

How will your user interact with your project?

**Scope alert! **Beware of scope creep. You do not want 1,000 choices!
Begin with the **overall experience **you want your audience to have. A
feeling, a concept, etc. Plan out the general beginning, middle, and end
points. Then fill in the details. 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-3 .unnumbered}

An **interactive, polished** narrative that:

-   a **complete narrative arc **(I\'m really just looking for a clear
    beginning, middle, and end).

-   unique **choices **on **most **of the passages (occasionally, for
    dramatic effect, you may want to limit the player to only one
    choice, but use this intentionally and sparingly)

-   makes a statement about (some aspect of) humanity (this can call
    attention to, question, critique, or celebrate)

-   **includes **a **text abstract/introduction** that:

    -   explains the statement the narrative makes (100-200 words)

    -   includes a least one **citation **of a **[scholarly
        source](https://guides.ucf.edu/c.php?g=78763&p=508976) **within
        the abstract 

        -   prove you aren\'t the only one seeing these issues in the
            world

        -   where can your audience go to learn more about your topic?

            -   [MLA citation
                guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html)

            -   [APA citation
                guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html)

#### File Format {#file-format .unnumbered}

-   **Website link**

1.  -   Please publish your narrative on your **digital portfolio
        website. **

        -   If you used a tool that requires a download, consider
            publishing it on for
            free [www.itch.io](http://www.itch.io/) and linking it to
            your site from there (include the password in the assignment
            comments if you password-protected it)

        -   Some website platforms will allow you to upload and store
            files to their site, but often for a fee.

        -   Genial.ly should allow you to embed the narrative directly
            to your website.

        -   **Please contact me if you have trouble with this step.**

-   **Abstract **- 2 options:

    1.  Text on your portfolio website beside/above/below the link to
        your narrative

    2.  Included **within **the narrative itself as an introduction or
        postlude

### Module Overview (Place & Space-Part B)

Now that you\'ve had a chance to tinker with the different tools we\'ll
be using to investigate different perspectives on place and space, we
take time this week to explore the ways that others have used digital
tools for these queries. As you read the chapter by Drucker, think about
how data can be combined with digital tools to make patterns more
obvious to the less familiar viewer. What different ways can you display
information for the user to interact with it in their own ways? How can
you help them come to conclusions that people \"inside\" various issues
have already drawn, without being preachy or confrontational? Or, how
might being confrontational or preachy about your issue help make your
point?

# Week 10: Digital Analysis (Part B)  {#week-10-digital-analysis-part-b .unnumbered}

## Learn {#learn-7 .unnumbered}

-   Read Rambsy article (Text-mining short fiction)

-   Read Drucker Ch. 7 (Data mining & analysis)

### Module Overview (Digital Analysis-Part B):

This week, we get a glimpse of how some scholars have used text-mining
tools to do different types of research. Rambsy\'s article demonstrates
the ways that Voyant can be used to better interpret and compare the
works of two authors, in a rather traditional literary critique.
Drucker\'s chapter, on the other hand, takes us beyond text analysis to
explore different ways that data can be displayed and distributed
digitally.

The three tools in this unit help the researcher gain a new perspective
on a large amount of text\--text from anywhere\--including social media.
However, it is less obvious how this module can be used as part of a
critical making project than the other, more creative tools, but this
unit is a helpful reminder that critical making projects that are
grounded in research are more compelling and meaningful than those that
only voice the artist\'s lived experience. What kinds of questions do
you seek to answer with Lab 4? How can this become part of a compelling
critical making project?

                or \"interesting topic.\"

            -   Your reply should demonstrate that you have read their
                full analysis and thought deeply about it as well as
                what this type of tool can and cannot do.

### Digital Analysis Lab

#### Assignment Rationale {#assignment-rationale-1 .unnumbered}

The tools in this unit are more traditional digital humanities research
tools, and they help researchers leverage technology to better
understand humans. The things you can analyze with the tools covered
here range from the best (high literature) to the worst (social media)
and everything between. What can you learn about humanity using these
tools? What interests you?

 

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-11 .unnumbered}

Explore the three different tools and consider the types of questions
you might be able to answer with each of them.

Then, do some searching for a lengthy text or website (if your tool
allows it). You could search a specific book, or several books by the
same author (or compare and contrast sets of books like the Rambsy
article in this unit). This link has [literary
corpora.](https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/literary-corpora) Not
into literature? Take a tour of this [corpora of political
speeches](https://digital.lib.hkbu.edu.hk/corpus/). Speak another
language? You might be interested in these corpora [in other
languages.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_corpora)

Once you find a large text, conduct your **scholarly research** to add
more dimension and perspective to your project. (See links under \"what
is due\" for helpful places to start). You can do this the other way
around, as well: first find 2 scholarly sources on a topic, then look
for a larger text to analyze.

What conclusions can you draw from your use of this tool? What
conclusions can you **not **draw from your use of this tool?

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-4 .unnumbered}

The **direct link to **a separate page (or blog post) **on your
website** that contains:

1.  A paragraph (\~2-3 sentences) explaining what you did
    (what **tool**, what body of **text**, and what **term **did you
    use?)

2.  A paragraph or two (\~100-150 words) explaining your **results **

    -   What did the **tool **tell you?

    -   What can you **conclude** based on what the tool told you?

    -   What **can\'t **you conclude?

3.  At least **two scholarly citations in parenthetical citation
    format:**

    -   **Remember, scholarly means peer-reviewed. At least 2 sources
        have to be from academic journals. These aren\'t websites or
        primary sources.**

    -   Who else is writing about this topic? 

    -   Who else has used this tool or a similar one to answer a similar
        question? (It can be on a different topic - \"This author\'s
        explanation of #blm helped me understand the tweets that
        included #pride\" or \"This author investigated the mention of
        the word \"woman\" in 19th century literature, and I searched
        for the same term in 17th century literature\" etc.)

        tip: click \"Cite\" on the right hand side once you find your
        article in here for the citation information)

4.  A **Works Cited or References** \"page\"

    -   Instead of a separate page, like it would be in a Word document,
        this will be a list under the paragraphs above

    -   Include a citation of **the tool** and a link to it in case your
        audience wants to try it out (just paste the one from the
        Webcourses page)

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-10 .unnumbered}

Let\'s shake it up a bit this week! In preparation for your Research
Assignments, I would like you to explore the scholarly databases that
you have access to through UCF and the wider Internet. 

Let\'s make some scavenger hunts!!

 

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-12 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **THREE POST assignment. **You will
first **create a scavenger hunt **that requires your peers to explore a
database that is **relevant to your** **research** interests. Then, you
will **reply to two classmates: **completing the scavenger hunt and
providing answers.

Look over some examples from a different class to gather ideas:

##### Scavenger Hunt 1 {#scavenger-hunt-1 .unnumbered}

-   Go to library: [https://www.loc.gov](https://loc.gov/)

-   In top right Search Box, select \"Manuscripts/Mixed Material\" in
    dropdown box to left of Search Box

-   In Search Box, type \"Alexander Hamilton\"

-   On left column, \"Available Online\" should be selected

-   In left column select a filter for the dates/years searched:
    \"1700 - 1799\"

-   In left column select an Online Format as \"Online Image\" 

-   What is the Name of the Poem Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1711 listed
    from this search? 

##### Scavenger Hunt 2: {#scavenger-hunt-2 .unnumbered}

-   Go to: UCF Libraries Homepage, or <https://library.ucf.edu/>

-   **Sign in** using your UCF ID login.

-   Click on **Journals Search.**

-   On the left-hand side of the screen, find **Journalism &
    Communications.**

-   The next page will have a drop down menu under Journalism and
    Communications. Click on **Journalism**.

-   Scroll down to the fifth or so list item, and click on **\'American
    Journalism\'**

-   **American Journalism **is a peer-reviewed US journal that has been
    active since 1981. Beginning as a trade publication with the purpose
    of defining and broadly communicating the terms of American
    Journalism, the research continues on today to teach journalism and
    explore issues in the field. 

-    Where you see the \"Search inside\" function under American
    Journalism, **type and search, \"Social Justice Journalism: A
    Cultural History of Social Movement Media from Abolition to
    #womensmarch.\"**

-   **Click the top result**, which should match the following title: 

-   Moore, Jennifer E. "Social Justice Journalism: A Cultural History of
    Social Movement Media from Abolition to #womensmarch: By Linda J.
    Lumsden, New York, Peter Lang, 2019, 308 Pp." *American Journalism*,
    vol. 38, no. 1, Routledge, 2021, pp. 110--12,
    doi:10.1080/08821127.2021.1865102.

-   **Click the link** labelled, Taylor & Francis Social Science &
    Humanities with Science & Technology

-   You can either read the entire article on the T&F web page or view
    the PDF. 

-   The article should be one page and eight paragraphs. The PDF should
    be four pages and eight paragraphs of the article. 

-   In the first paragraph, what does Linda Lumsden use for what
    purpose? (Answers may vary -- more than one person can answer this
    one). 

##### Scavenger Hunt 3: {#scavenger-hunt-3 .unnumbered}

-   Go to: library.ucf.edu.

-   Click on the \"Databases\" tab.

-   Click on the \"Databases by Subject\" button.

-   Select "Health, Medicine, and Nursing" under \"Databases by
    Subject.\"

-   Click on "Communication Sciences & Disorders."

-   Go to "MEDLINE (EBSCOhost)" listed under \"Relevant Databases.\"
    (MEDLINE was created by the National Library of Medicine. It
    utilizes Medical Subject Headings to search over 5,400 medical
    journals. This database provides academic, peer-reviewed articles on
    general medical information to more specific subjects, including
    veterinary science, nursing, and dentistry.)

-   Search for the following article under the general search bar:
    "Transformative Theatre: A Promising Educational Tool for Improving
    Health Encounters With LGBT Older Adults" and choose "Title" as the
    search parameter to the left of the "Search" button.

-   The results should show the following article as the first and only
    result: Hughes, Anne K., et al. "Transformative Theatre: A Promising
    Educational Tool for Improving Health Encounters with LGBT Older
    Adults." Gerontology & Geriatrics Education, vol. 37, no. 3, July
    2016, pp. 292--306. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1080/02701960.2015.1127812.

-   Click on the article title.

-   Select "Find @ UCF" to the left of the abstract.

-   Choose "Taylor & Francis Social Science & Humanities with Science &
    Technology" under "Full text availability."

-   Scroll down to the heading titled "Aggie's Story," or select this
    heading from the options to the left under "In this article."

-   What is the name of Aggie's partner?

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-5 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **THREE POST assignment: **

-   **Post 1:**

    -   **Create a scavenger hunt **that requires your peers to
        explore **three different databases **that are **relevant
        to your** **research** interests. Post the **link **to your
        digital analysis assignment on your digital portfolio

        -   This can be written out in the text box of the discussion
            board or posted somewhere on your digital portfolio site.

    -   The scavenger hunt should range from **6-12 steps. **It can have
        a specific, 1-word correct answer, a title/author as a correct
        answer or, as in the example of Scavenger Hunt 2, it could have
        several correct answers.

-   **Posts 2 and 3:** 

    -   **Complete only one scavenger hunt** by replying to the original
        post with the answer.

    -   **If it has already been answered, you must choose a different
        scavenger hunt to complete ***unless *you think the posted
        answer is incorrect.

    -   Reply to the person who answers your scavenger hunt that they
        are **correct or incorrect.**

    -   Please also answer any questions that your classmates ask you.

    -   NOTE: If there are no available scavenger hunts to complete
        (because your classmates have not posted theirs yet), you may
        complete one of the examples in this assignment, but you still
        can\'t complete one that has already been posted. **Please
        contact me if there are no available scavenger hunts.**

## Submit Research Assignment A: Research Proposal

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-11 .unnumbered}

This proposal is designed to help you narrow down your focus for your
research project, which includes Research Assignment B: Annotated
Bibliography, Research Assignment C: Abstract, and Research Assignment
D: Digital Project.

By planning out your project now, you will be setting yourself up for
success on the remaining assignments in this course. It will also give
me a chance to weigh in and help you scope your project to an
appropriate size for our purposes. 

### ** ** {#section-1 .unnumbered}

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-13 .unnumbered}

Look back at some of the examples of critical making in the Digital
Portfolio Part A  module, especially the Critical Making Examples page.

Then, look back at your Labs. What tool was your favorite? What topic
from your lab or your classmates\' labs captured your interest? What
topics would you be able to read about\--several sources in depth\--and
not go crazy with boredom? 

Conduct a preliminary search of **scholarly sources. **See the links
throughout the Research Project modules research resources. What\'s out
there? What has been done? What has not been done? How are academics
talking about these topics?

 

#### Tips and Resources {#tips-and-resources-1 .unnumbered}

The paper should include the standard MLA heading in the top left corner
(your name/ my name/ class title/ date; each on separate lines). 

The paper should be in first person: \"I plan to raise awareness of X
issue through Y tool.\"

You don\'t have to have your specific digital tool decided just yet, but
you should have it narrowed down to one or two options.

Remember, the theme to all of our critical making work in this course is
to make our audience think **differently about a topic** in order
to call attention to, question, critique, or celebrate some larger
aspect of humanity.

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-6 .unnumbered}

A short research proposal paper (submitted here OR posted on your
digital portfolio website) that:

-   Uses proper MLA or APA formatting (your choice).

-   Includes a **clear focus** that calls attention to, questions,
    critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of humanity.

-   Lists one **scholarly **source that is on the topic of your
    project\'s focus. (Example: an article in a **scholarly
    journal** that describes, defines, or raises awareness of the same
    problem, like an article defining a critical theory, or an article
    that explains the history of an issue your project discusses.) It
    should be obvious how this source informs your project, but please
    take a sentence or three to **explain **how it does so.

-   Describes how a digital tool that we have used in this class that
    might be used for this project (if you are undecided, you can
    describe 2 possibilities) 

-   Lists the key resources you\'ll need to use: Where can you go
    for **help with the tool? **What **database or types of scholarly
    sources **will you use?

-   Describes a **work plan **for the project. What will you do first?
    What might take the longest amount of time? Plot it out in a list or
    table using the deadlines for the remaining research assignments. 

-   The length requirement for this proposal is \~200-300 words (a
    little over or under is fine). You may want to use **headings **to
    organize your paper- just please use phrases rather than the entire
    sentence from the assignment.

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-12 .unnumbered}

Each week, you will be asked to **complete an activity and reflect on
it:** thinking deeply about the process of making and experimenting with
various digital tools. 

**This week, I\'d like you to share your research progress with your
classmates** as well as **reflect on your process **and **read about the
process of others in the course. **It also can be helpful to look at
other digital narratives to get ideas to improve your own.

 

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-14 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **THREE POST assignment. **

You will first **post 3 sources cited in MLA or APA style **(include
links, please) and write a **brief reflection** on your research
progress so far. Think about where you might appreciate having advice or
the opinion of someone else.

Then, you will **reply to two classmates **offering advice
or **specific **feedback.

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-7 .unnumbered}

Be aware that each week, this is a **THREE POST assignment: **

-   **Post 1:**

    -   Post **3 sources cited in MLA or APA style **(include links,
        please). This should just be done directly in the discussion
        board post.

    -   **Reflect **on your research progress so far.   

        -   Why did you choose your **topic**?

        -   What have you already **learned?**

        -   What database was the most helpful so far?

        -   What information are you struggling to find? 

        -   **3-5 sentences minimum.**

-   **Posts 2 and 3:** 

    -   **Reply **to at least two people with **specific feedback. At
        least 3 sentences.**

        -   If they struggled with a specific search tool or database
            and you have a suggestion or a link to a tutorial, share
            your advice!

        -   If they struggled with other aspects of the research process
            and you have a suggestion, offer it!

        -   If you think they did something **well, **tell them!

            -   This needs to be **specific **to get full credit.

            -   Do **NOT **reply with a vague, \"Wow great sources\" or
                \"interesting topic.\"

            -   Your reply should demonstrate that you have read their
                reflection and thought deeply about it as well as what
                kinds of sources would be beneficial to their project. 

### Submit Research Assignment B: Annotated Bibliography: {#submit-research-assignment-b-annotated-bibliography .unnumbered}

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-13 .unnumbered}

This course is carries a Research Intensive designation. By the end of
this course, you should have improved your research skills\--both
traditional, library/database searching skills as well as the kinds of
research that goes into critical making projects.

Completing a literature review now will enhance your final project
immensely. Being aware of and understanding the kinds of things that
other scholars and critical makers are saying and doing about your topic
will help you create a more meaningful and more compelling final
project. 

 

#### Where to Start  {#where-to-start-15 .unnumbered}

Look over the research resources links in the Research Project modules.
Search for your topic using several different databases (this can
include [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), but you should
not ***only ***use Google Scholar).

Decide what **keywords **fit with your specific topic. For example, if
my project will critique the overuse of gamification in education, I
will need to search for \"gamification,\" of course, but also
\"videogames,\" \"video games,\" and maybe even \"educational
technology\" or \"learning games\" and \"video games for teaching\" and
so forth. 

Note if there are any **related topics** worth including in your review.
For the gamification example above, many businesses have also adopted
gamification strategies: stores award loyalty points, exercise apps use
badges, etc. If I were to write a detailed paper about gamification, I
would have a sentence in the introduction that says something like
\"Gamification is used in businesses from coffee shops (citation) to gym
memberships (citation).\" I may also wish to compare and contrast the
ways that gamification is used in education and business settings\--this
would necessitate even more citations from the business use of
gamification. If your project focuses on a specific marginalized
community (say, people who have vision impairments), you could research
the treatment of **other **marginalized communities (people who have
hearing loss) to build on your understanding of the ways that these
\"different\" populations are excluded or treated. 

 

#### Example Entry (MLA format) {#example-entry-mla-format .unnumbered}

Gee, James Paul. *What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and
Literacy*. New York, New York: Macmillan, 2003.

This book describes the ways that video games are designed to teach the
player how the to play the game. Contemporary video game players do not
usually read a separate manual or tutorial before they begin to play a
video game; they just start the game and try to play. Gee provides
numerous examples of how games scaffold the player\'s learning by
introducing obstacles and enemies slowly and includes a list of "36
learning principles" that video games follow.

This book encourages educators to consider how video games teach things
and to contemplate games as learning tools in their classrooms. It is
likely instrumental in fostering the rush to add games to education, and
gamification is a hollow misinterpretation of the key elements in this
book. 

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-8 .unnumbered}

An annotated bibliography that includes:

-   10-15 **scholarly **sources in MLA or APA citation format

    -   [MLA citation
        guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html);  [APA
        citation
        guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html)

    -   If needed, you may include one newspaper article or
        other *non*-scholarly source that **demonstrates or helps
        clearly define*** *the reason this topic is an issue suitable
        for a critical making project (for example, an opinion piece
        about why critical race theory should or should not be taught in
        schools)

    -   You may only include more than one newspaper article if your
        topic is **too recent** to have many books and scholarly
        articles (like the attacks on Ukraine) but please try to find
        related **scholarly **sources as well

-   Under each source, provide a 50-150 word **single
    spaced** annotation

    -   A summary of the source

    -   No more than one quotation from the source

    -   An explanation in **the last sentence** telling me why this
        source is included in your list: what does it help you
        understand or articulate in this project? (This can be its own
        one-sentence paragraph to make this easier to read)

Note: The document can be single spaced or double spaced\--whichever you
prefer.

    Showcase by Nov. 15

### Submit Research Assignment C: Abstract: {#submit-research-assignment-c-abstract .unnumbered}

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-14 .unnumbered}

An abstract is the key element that takes your project from \"cool,
interesting project\" to \"critical making project\" - without a clear
articulation of the scholarship behind your work, it is more of a work
of art or a prototype than a compelling digital humanities statement.

Plus, you\'ve just done a ton of research! Show off what you\'ve learned
about your topic in the abstract as well as in the final project. 

This is due at the same time as [Research Assignment D: Digital
Project](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1405610/assignments/7524502).
You may incorporate the abstract into your digital project OR post it
next to the link to your project on your digital portfolio. This writing
piece is the first thing future employers and fans will read when they
look at your project on your website and exclaim, \"Cool! What\'s
this?!\"

 

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-16 .unnumbered}

Look over your [Research Assignment B: Annotated
Bibliography](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1405610/assignments/7524504) and
even back at your [Research Assignment A: Research
Proposal](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1405610/assignments/7524503).
What was your goal? Has it changed as you created your project and
conducted your research? (Don\'t worry, this happens a lot!)

Think about how you would describe your project to someone else in the
class, or even another digital humanities minor or professor. What
larger aspect of humanity are you calling attention to, questioning,
critiquing, or celebrating? What do your other sources say about this
topic?

Abstract: Title of Project

This is an example abstract, but Webcourses is annoying and won\'t allow
me to indent this first line. I could do that in Word and upload that
document in Webcourses, or I could just separate my paragraphs if
needed, with a blank space like below this line.

I\'m not really going to write an abstract here. If I did put words
here, however, I would make sure that it was within the word limit. I
would include sample citations, as well (Lastname). Quoting sources is
not a good idea in an abstract. Keep it short and focused
(Another-Citation). Finally, here\'s a sentence that shows how to cite
several (Citation) different (Different) sources that make similar
points (Similar) or are on the same topic.

Works Cited

Another-Citation, Firstname. \"Here\'s an article.\" *Journal Name
59, *12-47.

Citation, Firstname. \"Here\'s another article.\" *Journal Name 98,
23*-42.

Different, Firstname. *I\'m a Book. *City: Publisher, 2019.

Lastname, Firstname. \"Here\'s an article.\" *Journal Name 19, 87-101*.

Similar, Firstname. \"Here\'s an article.\" *Journal Name 29, *92-147.

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-9 .unnumbered}

An abstract (200-300 words) or extended abstract (500 words) that:

-   Clearly articulates the critical statement of your project (what
    it calls attention to, questions, critiques, or celebrates)

-   Cites at least 5 sources from your [Annotated
    Bibliography](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1405610/assignments/7524504)

-   Includes a Works Cited or References section below the abstract that
    shows the sources (this does **not **count toward your word limit)

-   Follows MLA or APA consistently.

#### Reason for the Assignment {#reason-for-the-assignment-15 .unnumbered}

It is important to celebrate your accomplishments, and it\'s a valuable
skill to be able to explain and demonstrate your digital work.

Plus, you all worked so hard on this final assignment -  let\'s take a
minute to show off!

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-17 .unnumbered}

If you signed up to participate in the [Amy Zeh High-Impact Practice
Student
Showcase](https://academicsuccess.ucf.edu/explearning/students/amy-zeh-high-impact-practice-student-showcase/) this
semester, [look at those submission
instructions](https://academicsuccess.ucf.edu/explearning/students/amy-zeh-high-impact-practice-student-showcase/student-participant-directions/),
and create your project page in STARS.

Look at the requirements for the [Student Scholar Symposium
presentations](https://researchweek.ucf.edu/eligibility/). Then, make a
short (2-5 minute) video that follows these guidelines. Consider
participating in the Spring showcase\--and let me know!

##### Make sure your video: {#make-sure-your-video .unnumbered}

-   **demonstrates **your digital project

-   explains the **critical statement** and your overall **intent** for
    the project. 

-   explains** your process:** include a little bit about **how **you
    went about this work and **why**

I suggest using free screencapture software and recording your voice as
you demonstrate your project on your screen. (If you log into Zoom with
your UCF NID, you should be able to select \"record to the cloud\" and
it will automatically add captions to your video. YouTube will do this
automatically only if the video is set to \"unlisted\" or
\"public\"\--it won\'t transcribe \"private\" videos).

##### Then, post your video to YellowDig!  {#then-post-your-video-to-yellowdig .unnumbered}

#### What is Due in YellowDig {#what-is-due-in-yellowdig-8 .unnumbered}

-   **Part 1 (Exercise) **

    -   Post your video.

-   **Part 2 (Reflection)**

    -   In writing or speech, reflect on your experience,  process, etc.
        This reflection piece can be integrated into the video itself OR
        you can write it as part of the post with your video.

-   **Part 3 (Discussion) **

    -   Make positive or constructive comments on your peers\' posts to
        earn the remainder of your weekly points.

    -   Helpful constructive comments might suggest things they could
        add or expand their project to cover in the future for the
        Student Scholar Symposium, another class, or grad school. 

Note: This assignment is also called \"Exercise 12\" in some places -
apologies for any confusion! 

 ✨** Congratulations, you did it! **✨

### Research Project Part D: Digital Project 

#### Reason for the Assignment  {#reason-for-the-assignment-16 .unnumbered}

You\'ve worked your way through a ton of digital tools this semester!
This is the chance to show off your amazing new skills and research
knowledge with a final digital project! 

This project should accompany your Research Assignment C: Abstract on
your digital portfolio site (OR your abstract will be incorporated into
the project itself-your choice). This project combined with your
researched abstract will demonstrate that you have valuable skills
that **every employer **wants: the ability to conduct research and the
ability to learn new digital skills. *Let\'s show this off!*  

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-18 .unnumbered}

You will probably be working on this at the same time as Research
Assignment C: Abstract, so let that inform your process! What are you
reading in the research that is surprising? What are the key facts and
feelings that you\'d like to share with your audience? How can we think
differently about your topic?

If you\'re following your **workplan **from the Research Assignment A:
Research Proposal, then you are likely on the right track! Just keep
following it! 

If you have changed your topic or digital tool since the Research
Proposal, that\'s fine, too! Just plan out what you need to do before
the deadline and get going!

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-10 .unnumbered}

The URL to your digital portfolio where this project is displayed (the
URL can go directly to the project OR to the page where the project is
accompanied by the abstract).** **

Your project should:

-   Incorporate** meaningful interactive **elements 

-   Make a critical statement that calls attention to, questions,
    critiques, or celebrates some larger aspect of humanity (This part
    will be fully explained in the abstract, but it should come through
    in the project as well)

-   Feels complete **and polished **(as polished as a critical making
    prototype can be) or is **intentionally incomplete and unpolished.**

# Week 15: Thanksgiving & Native American Heritage Day (Nothing due November 28) {#week-15-thanksgiving-native-american-heritage-day-nothing-due-november-28 .unnumbered}

# **Week 16: Final** Assignments due by 11:59pm Thursday, December 5: {#week-16-final-assignments-due-by-1159pm-thursday-december-5 .unnumbered}

## Submit Final Reflection {#submit-final-reflection .unnumbered}

####  {#section-3 .unnumbered}

#### Reason for Assignment  {#reason-for-assignment .unnumbered}

Metacognitive reflection has been demonstrated to promote deep learning
and improve students\' future self-regulated learning skills. 

Also, I hope to teach this course again in the future, so I appreciate
any and all feedback about your class experience!

 

#### Where to Start {#where-to-start-19 .unnumbered}

Reflect on the semester. What have you learned? How have you grown? Are
you closer to your career goals than when you started? What are you
proud of, and what will you work to avoid in the future? 

 

#### What is Due {#what-is-due-11 .unnumbered}

A brief **reflection (300 words or more)** on the** **type of work you
want to do in the future and how your work this semester will fit your
portfolio that answers the questions: 

-   What have you **learned** this semester?

-   **What was this class experience like for you? **

-   How has your work in this course helped to move you closer to your
    **goals**? 

-   Optional:

    -   How can this course be **improved**?

    -   What were your **favorite **aspects of the course assignments,
        pages, and resources? 

    -   What did you think about the **research intensive **elements?

    -   **What other digital tools do you wish we had covered?**

 

#### Feeling Creative? Format options: {#feeling-creative-format-options .unnumbered}

-   Traditional essay format that thoroughly and honestly addresses the
    three bulleted questions above in 300 words or more. 

-   Rather than a traditional essay format, frame this as an \"about
    me\" or \"self-evaluation\" page on your digital portfolio website,
    focusing of course on your most recent course and what you learned
    in it. Be sure to thoroughly and honestly address the three bulleted
    questions above. **Actually posting this to your digital portfolio
    site is *optional*.** 

-   Frame this as a response to an interview question: \"Tell me about
    your most recent college course\" (i.e. what job-specific skills
    have you learned or improved by completing this course?) Be sure to
    thoroughly and honestly address the three bulleted questions
    above. This can be written or it can be an **audio or video
    recording** (Zoom or YouTube link or upload a narrated PowerPoint,
    mp3, or mp4 if it\'s not embedded on your digital portfolio site).

-   In **any** format (essay, slideshow, video, etc.), frame this as a
    retrospective that focuses on your experience with the course, using
    the \"4L model: explain what you **Liked, **what
    you **Learned, **what the course **Lacked, **and what you **Longed
    for **in the course.
