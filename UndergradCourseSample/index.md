## DIG 3171: Digital Tools for the Humanities

### I. Course Description

Examination of digital tools and techniques, including web and games,
used for projects and research in digital humanities. This section of
DIG 3171 is a **Research-Intensive (RI) course**. This designation will
be noted on your transcripts. You will actively engage in research
processes and a significant portion of your grade will be derived from
course-related project(s) based on original research and/or creative
scholarship.

### II. Course Purpose & Objectives

The course examines digital humanities tools through the lens of
critical making. This course provides an introduction to digital
humanities discourse, intentional design, multimodal development, and
digital tools.

Students will be able to:

-   Use emerging technologies to conduct and disseminate humanities
    research.
-   Understand the role of the Internet in the humanities.
-   Conduct humanities research with a variety of software.
-   Display their digital work on a professional digital portfolio.
-   Engage in scholarly discourse around the digital humanities.
-   Conduct and present original critical making research.

### IV. Course Requirements

#### Exercises & Conversations

***Each week***, you will be asked to **complete an activity, reflect on
it, and discuss your process.** I am always experimenting
with new platforms to enhance our conversations. This semester, we will
use **Yellowdig.** This multimodal platform rewards participation with a
weekly point maximum, so you will need to post weekly exercises that
consist of 3 parts: exercise, reflection, & replies. For full marks,
you'll need to post **several times each week**.

The **first exercise is the Academic Verification Activity**, which is
due by the end of the first week of classes. *Yellowdig awards each
student per activity, with a weekly maximum limit.* There are 12
Exercises and one optional exercise on the Fall schedule.

**Final Reflection Paper (8 points):** This paper **serves as your final
exam for this course:** a short reflection on your experience in the
course and outline your next steps for your research, career goals, etc.

#### Labs

**Labs** are hands-on critical making assignments to help you learn
about each digital humanities tool and how projects using the tool fit
in the overall discourse of the field. Resources and **optional, virtual
class times are available** for each of the four lab assignments.

In the first lab, you will create a digital portfolio, and you will post
the remaining assignments and labs there. **This course emphasizes
process over product**; the research and thought behind each digital
product is much more important than the appearance of digital product
itself.

#### Research Assignments

The major research component of this course is broken into 4 smaller
research assignments: A) Project Proposal, B) Annotated Bibliography, C)
Abstract, D) Digital Project.
