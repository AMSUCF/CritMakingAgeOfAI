**<u>I. Course Description</u>**

Examination of digital tools and techniques, including web and games, used for projects and research in digital humanities. This section of DIG 3171 is a **Research-Intensive (RI) course**. This designation will be noted on your transcripts. You will actively engage in research processes and a significant portion of your grade will be derived from course-related project(s) based on original research and/or creative scholarship. If you have any questions about this designation or HIP designations at UCF, please contact <hip@ucf.edu>

<img src="images/media/image1.JPG" style="width:1.96111in;height:2.72639in" alt="A picture containing text, writing implement, indoor, stationary Description automatically generated" />**Prerequisites**: ENC 1102; ENC1101

**<u>II. Course Purpose & Objectives</u>**

The course examines digital humanities tools through the lens of critical making. This course provides an introduction to digital humanities discourse, intentional design, multimodal development, and digital tools.

Students will be able to:

- Use emerging technologies to conduct and disseminate humanities research.

- Understand the role of the Internet in the humanities.

- Conduct humanities research with a variety of software.

- Display their digital work on a professional digital portfolio.

- Engage in scholarly discourse around the digital humanities.

- Conduct and present original critical making research.

4.  Additional required readings and resources are accessible in Webcourses

***All texts are free eBooks.** Some links ask for UCF login credentials.*

**<u>IV. Course Requirements\*</u>**

**Exercises & Conversations**

***Each week***, you will be asked to **complete an activity, reflect on it, <u>and</u> discuss your process.** I am always experimenting with new platforms to enhance our conversations. This semester, we will use **Yellowdig.** This multimodal platform rewards participation with a weekly point maximum, so you will need to post weekly exercises that consist of 3 parts: exercise, reflection, & replies. For full marks, you’ll need to post **several times each week**.

The **first exercise is the Academic Verification Activity**, which is due by the end of the first week of classes. *Yellowdig awards each student per activity, with a weekly maximum limit.* There are 12 Exercises and one optional exercise on the Fall schedule.

**Final Reflection Paper (8 points):** This paper **serves as your final exam for this course:** a short reflection on your experience in the course and outline your next steps for your research, career goals, etc.

**Labs**

**Labs** are hands-on critical making assignments to help you learn about each digital humanities tool and how projects using the tool fit in the overall discourse of the field. Resources and **optional, virtual class times are available** for each of the four lab assignments.

In the first lab, you will create a digital portfolio, and you will post the remaining assignments and labs there. **This course emphasizes process over product**; the research and thought behind each digital product is much more important than the appearance of digital product itself.

**Research Assignments**

The major research component of this course is broken into 4 smaller research assignments: A) Project Proposal, B) Annotated Bibliography, C) Abstract, D) Digital Project.

**\***Detailed instructions and rubrics are available in Webcourses.
